Hello world,


to build this package you just need "snappy-tools" installed on your system and run:

 $ snappy build .

to produce your snappy package that you can install on your local snappy VM.

Alternatively, you can intall it using 

 $ snappy install example.python-xkcd-webserver

on your running snappy instance.


Enjoy,

 - Your Snappy Team
